## Features from Localsite.js

**param object** - Contains key-values from the current URL hash, parameters in the URL, and parameters set on the javascript include file.  

**hashChangeEvent** is triggered when the hash is changed programmatically and by the user.  This allows multiple widgets to respond to changes without being directly bound.  

## Features of showdown markup-to-html

**loadMarkdown** - Loads readme files and converts links and image tags based on folder level.
